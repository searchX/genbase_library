  /// [model] is id of the model to use. You can use the `text-davinci-edit-001` or `code-davinci-edit-001` model with this method.
  ///
  /// [input] is the input text to use as a starting point for the edit.
  ///
  /// [instruction] is the instruction that tells the model how to edit the prompt.
  ///
  /// [n] defines how many edits to generate for the input and instruction.
  ///
  /// [temperature] defines what sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
  ///
  /// [topP] defines an alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
